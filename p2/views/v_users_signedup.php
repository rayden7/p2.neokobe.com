<p>Next you will be receiving an email with instructions on how to activate your
    account, which you must do before you can log in and begin to use the amazing
    features of our website.</p>
<p>Once you've activated your account, you should explore all there is to do on
    our site!  You can start by viewing some of the <a href="/posts/index">public
    posts</a> others have made, and then you can <a href="/posts/add">create some
    posts</a> of your own.</p>
<p>Once you've gotten comfortable posting your own content, most users like to
    start <a href="/posts/index">following</a> other friends, and then you will
    get a custom view of just the <a href="/users/following">friends you are
    following</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy your new account!</p>
