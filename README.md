In addition to the defined required features of:

* Sign up
* Log in
* Log out
* Add posts
* See a list of all other users
* Follow and unfollow other users
* View a stream of posts from the users you follow
* +2 other features of your choosing

The two other features I added were:

* the ability to log in or log out from any page on the site (login/logout bar at top of all pages)
* a more robust profile page, showing the time the user joined the site, number of total posts, last login time, and most recent posting
* a 3-stage signup process:
** stage 1: when signing up for a new account, user must enter a username, email, and password (and confirm email and password 2x to reduce change of error)
** stage 2: user is sent an email with an account activation link they must click on before they can login to the site
** stage 3: once the user has clicked the activation link they may log into the site
